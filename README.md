# House-Prices---Advanced-Regression-Techniques
Predicting sales prices and practice feature engineering, RFs, and gradient boosting
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. 
The workflow included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the application of multiple regression algorithms, such as:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
Ridge Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
LightGBM Regressor
CatBoost Regressor
Voting Regressor

I created pipelines for data preprocessing and model evaluation, allowing for streamlined testing of each algorithm. After experimenting with these models, I identified the best-performing model based on mean absolute error, achieving a score of 0.1301.

Through this project, I learned the importance of model selection and tuning in machine learning, as well as the effectiveness of using pipelines for efficient workflow management.
